gRPC is used to submit the location data from the mobile devices to the kafka queue.
It provides the necessary performance for high frequency location updates.

Kafka works as a buffer in front of the database, in case postgres can't keep up with the amount of data.

The frontend uses REST APIs to load the data.

The API is split by service. Persons, locations and connections have their own microservies that access the database.
